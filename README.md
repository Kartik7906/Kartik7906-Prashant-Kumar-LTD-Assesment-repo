# E-commerce Order Management System - Part 1

This project is a simple **E-commerce Order Management System** built using JavaScript. It consists of four main classes: `User`, `Product`, `Order`, and `Payment`. The system simulates the process of creating users, placing orders, adding products to the orders, making payments, and updating order statuses. This model is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create and manage users with unique IDs, names, and emails.
- **Product Management**: Add products with unique IDs, names, and prices.
- **Order Management**: Users can place orders with multiple products, view total amounts, and update the status of the orders.
- **Payment Processing**: Payments can be processed for orders with status updates.

## Project Structure

### Classes

1. **User**: Represents a customer with user ID, name, email, and a list of their orders.
2. **Product**: Represents a product with a product ID, name, and price.
3. **Order**: Represents an order with an order ID, user ID, status (pending/shipped), and a list of products.
4. **Payment**: Represents a payment with a payment ID, order ID, amount, and status (pending/completed).

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Create a new user
const user1 = new User(1, 'Kartik', 'kartik@example.com');

// Create a new product
const product1 = new Product(101, 'Laptop', 1200);

// Create an order for the user
const order1 = new Order(201, user1.userId);
order1.addProduct(product1);

// Process a payment for the order
const payment1 = new Payment(301, order1.orderId, order1.getTotalAmount());
payment1.completePayment();
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-management-system.git
   cd order-management-system
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   You can run this JavaScript file in any modern browser or with Node.js. If you use Node.js, follow these steps:

   - Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Run the following command to execute the file:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The script will output user orders, total amounts, order status, and payment details in the console.

## Alternative Implementations

There are several ways to extend or refactor this model:

1. **Use a Database**: Implement a database (like MongoDB or MySQL) to store user, product, and order data persistently.
2. **Frontend Integration**: Build a frontend with a library like React to allow users to interact with the system through a web interface.
3. **API-Based Architecture**: Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to expose endpoints for managing users, products, orders, and payments.
4. **Expand Payment System**: Add more complexity to the payment system (e.g., partial payments, refunds, different payment methods).
5. **Add Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth for a secure experience.
6. **Improve Order Tracking**: Add real-time order tracking and notifications using WebSockets or a service like Firebase.
